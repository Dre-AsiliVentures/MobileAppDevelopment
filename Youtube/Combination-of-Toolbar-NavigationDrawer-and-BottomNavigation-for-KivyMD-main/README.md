# Combination of Toolbar, NavigationDrawer & BottomNavigation for KivyMD
This code compiles the toolbar, navigation drawer and bottom navigation from KivyMD.
I created this program for a project.
Visually, it's amazing. 
The problem I found is that the way the ScreenManager works is different from the 'normal' Kivy.
Be careful of that. 
In order for this code to work, previously install Kivy & KivyMD.
Please, put the images of "teslaprueba.png" and "tec_borrego.png" in a folder named "images". 
If you don't do this, the images won't be displayed in the interface.
Cheers, mates.
